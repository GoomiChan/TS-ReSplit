# TS-ReSplit

ReSplit is a reverse engineering effort for the TimeSplitters games, currently focused on TimeSplitters 2.
Plan is to document the file formats and some of how the game's engine worked and to provide a library to interact with those formats.
Then on top of that to build a framework for loading and using those assets in a TimeSplitters like game using Unity as the base engine, like a PC port with some extra visual niceties.
**I don't and won't provide any TimeSplitters assets**, you will have to provide those yourself, think of this project like a replacement engine for the game, in the same vein as OpenMorrowwind and OpenRA.

This project is very much a work in progress.
